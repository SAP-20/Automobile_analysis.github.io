A strategic group is a concept used in strategic management that groups companies within an industry that have similar business models or similar combinations of strategies. For example, the restaurant industry can be divided into several strategic groups including fast-food and fine-dining based on variables such as preparation time, pricing, and presentation. The number of groups within an industry and their composition depends on the dimensions used to define the groups. Strategic management professors and consultants often make use of a two dimensional grid to position firms along an industry's two most important dimensions in order to distinguish direct rivals (those with similar strategies or business models) from indirect rivals.

The automotive industry is one of the largest industries out there it's a 2.6 trillion dollar industry!

But inside the industry there are too many categories and subcategories constructed by too many variables that it almost safe to say that every category is an industry of itself. for instance the car body variable is a vital one, as diffrernt body types are being used for very different reason here is a list of some car body type:

* SEDAN
* COUPE
* STATION WAGON
* HATCHBACK
* CONVERTIBLE
